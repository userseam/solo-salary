### errors

I had some mayor issues with refering back to my loop without makeing a cluster
bomb of code and figured that I instead could refrens a function that all ready contains the loop and I 
can there for run it in the try: without any mayor problems 
 
  * changed the for loop for and added a print(input) instead


changed the days variabel data type from list to dict to store the input awanser as a value 

I couldent count the dicotanry specific values so I instead imported a extrenal solution that 
made it possibel to instead extract the nummber of one spesific input value and stored it in a variabel
that could later on be referensed to
